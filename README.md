# Chess
This Java project was my final project for CIS111B - Computer Science II: Object-Oriented Programming.
It is still a work in progress, but I plan on using it as a foundation for a similar web application.

## Features
Features include the chess board, a move notation sheet, a display of taken pieces, and a button to flip the board. 

#### Player vs. Player (Local)
  - The GUI consitsts of 4 main components.
